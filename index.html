      <h2>About Wyatt Archer</h2>

      <p>
        I’ve been making music in one form or another for more than 25 years. It started in church,
        then grew into different side projects over the years — writing, playing, experimenting,
        chasing ideas whenever they showed up.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the way technology has evolved, I decided to build something new: an online persona
        and digital artist named <strong>Wyatt Archer</strong> — named after my dog. What started as
        curiosity has turned into something I genuinely love. Using modern tools, apps, plugins,
        and instruments, I can take a concept, build the music, write the lyrics, record my guitar,
        and bring a song to life from start to finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the songs reflect my own journey — the highs, the mistakes, the lessons. Others are
        stories pulled from imagination or inspired by people and places along the way. But all of
        them come from somewhere honest.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you enjoy what you hear, I’d be grateful for a follow and a like to stay connected as
        new music rolls out.
